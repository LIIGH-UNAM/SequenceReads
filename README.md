The file QG17.fastq contains sequence reads in fastq format from S. cerevisiae yeast strain S288C.
Sequencing libraries were prepared using the TruSeq DNA PCR-Free sample preparation Kit from Illumina.
Sequencing was performed in a Next Seq 500 sequencer using the Next Seq 500/550 Mid Output Reagent, 300 cycles. 
Sequencing was performed at about 100X coverage.
